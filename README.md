# Real-Time Audio Programming In C
Teaching material for the programming seminar ["Real-Time Audio Programming In C"](https://www.ak.tu-berlin.de/menue/lehre/sommersemester_2021/real_time_audio_programmierung_in_c/) of the summer semester 2021.


Because we want to write externals for PD in this course, coding style is based on [Miller Puckette](http://msp.ucsd.edu/).

Therefore, there are the following spelling conventions:

### Functions:
```pseudoClassInLowerCamelCase_methodOfTheClassObject```

### Structs:

```C
typedef struct _structName
{
  ...
} t_structName
```


#### Legal issues:
This repository contains several licenses. Third-party code samples that deviate from the root directory of our GPL license are in the same folder as these files. This is quite simple: it applies the license, which can be found in the lowest folder hierarchy.
