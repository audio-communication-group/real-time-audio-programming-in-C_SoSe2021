Pure Data:

1. Create a PD-Patch and build a simple FM Synthesis

C-coding:

16: Implement the function "what_to_do" with if-statements only.


17: Move the variable j to the file 17_static_extern_global_var.c and access it in main.c with the keyword extern.


18: Write thePermanentHeap() function with pointer arithmetic instead of the array index access method:      *aHeapPointer++ = i;
    In the main function print out all values instead of the index 4 only. Be careful what you return in thePermanentHeap() function!


19: Write a function that allocates memory for integers with calloc and returns the allocated memory as an int pointer.
	The function should have two int arguments:
	the number of integers to allocate, and a default value. Every int field of the allocated memory should be initialized with this default value.	
	Call this function from main instead of calling calloc directly.
